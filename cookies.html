                    <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored; however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">How We Use Cookies<br></h2>
                    <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">Disabling Cookies<br></h2>
                    <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of the site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="display-4">The Cookies We Set<br></h2>
                    <h3>Google Analytics<br></h3>
                    <p>This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and trusted analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content.<br></p>
                    <p>For more information on Google Analytics cookies, see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage" target="_blank">official Google Analytics page</a>.<br></p>
                    <h3>Hotjar<br></h3>
                    <p>We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.<br></p>
                    <h3>Other Analytics Tools<br></h3>
                    <p>Other analytics tools may be used to track and measure the usage of this site so that we can continue to produce engaging content. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on the site or pages you visit which helps us to understand how we can improve the site for you.<br></p>
                    <p>From time to time, we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered. When we are still testing new features, these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience while on the site, helping us understand which optimizations our users appreciate the most.<br></p>
                    <h3>Forms-Related Cookies<br></h3>
                    <p>We use the function of the third-party provider, 123formbuilder, on this website. The contact form has been created using the 123formbuilder service.<br></p>
                    <p>PHPSESSID is a simple token used by all PHP applications to identify your unique session. The main purpose of the cookie is to maintain the integrity of your session while transacting information with the 123formbuilder service (accessing secure areas, forms submissions, etc). It does not store any personal data and is deleted when the visitor closes their browser.<br></p>
                    <ul></ul>
                    <h2 class="display-4">More Information</h2>
                    <p>Hopefully this has clarified things for you and, as was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled, in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
                    <p>However, if you are still looking for more information, you can contact us by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>.</p>
